# Pokemon Crawler

### Greetings

Hey Guys, Cool little project idea. Cheers!


### What I did
You'll see that I made some minor changes to your original setup, just to persist the volumes on the db. I also installed requests, as my preferred may of making the API required for the task. I added a precommit too, to keep everything formatted to the appropriate standards.  

The following commands will get you up and running:

`make f make-poke makemigrations`

`make f make-poke migrate`

`make f make-poke up`

`make f make-poke catch_some` (If you want to do a quick run and see how it works) 

`make f make-poke catch_em_all` (If you want everything - a lot of these requests would probably be better suited to a celery schedule)

Then, log into the admin and take a look at what you have

Keen to chat about this with you tomorrow!

#### ðŸŽ‰ Happy Reviewing! ðŸŽ‰
